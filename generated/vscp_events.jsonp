The types in this class must be handled by all level I and Level II nodes. Note also that this class is repeated as Level II class=512 with the only difference that GUID's are used instead of nicknames. This means that for all Level II class=512 events the data described here is preceded by the 16-bit destination GUID (address of receiver) stored with MSB first followed by the data specified here. Nickname is present also if documented below but have no meaning and should be discarded.\n\nAll other events are optional except for **one exception**. All nodes should send [CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 (HEARTBEAT)](./class1.information.md#type9) at least once every minute.\n",

		"description": "**Not mandatory.** Implement in device if needed by application. \n\nA segment controller sends this event once a second on the segment that it controls. The data field contains the 8-bit CRC of the segment controller GUID and the time since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970) as a 32-bit value. A node that receive (and recognize) this event could respond with a CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 event (HEARTBEAT) and should do so if it does not send out a regular heartbeat event.\n\nOther nodes can originate this event on the segment. For these nodes the data part, as specified below, should be omitted. A better choice for periodic heartbeat events from a node may be [CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 (HEARTBEAT)](./class1.information.md#type9)\n\nAll nodes that recognize this event should save the 8-bit CRC in non-volatile storage and use it on power up. When a node starts up on a segment it should begin to listen for the Segment controller heartbeat. When/if it is received the node compares it with the stored value and if equal and the node is assigned a nickname-ID it continues to its working mode. If different, the node has detected that it has been moved to a new segment and therefore must drop its nickname-ID and enters the configuration mode to obtain a new nickname-ID from the segment controller.\n\nIf the node is in working mode and its nickname-ID changes, the node should do a complete restart after first setting all controls to their default state.\n\nAs a segment can be without a segment controller this event is not available on all segments and is not mandatory. \n\n | Data byte | Description | \n | :---------: | ----------- | \n | 0 | 8-bit CRC of the segment controller GUID. | \n | 1 | MSB of time since epoch (optional). |\n | 2  | Time since epoch (optional). | \n | 3         | Time since epoch (optional).|\n | 4         | LSB of time since epoch | \n\nUninitiated nodes have the CRC of the segment controller set to 0xFF.\n\nA node that is initialized on a segment and does not receive a Heartbeat can take the role of segment controller if it wishes to do so. Only one node one a segment are allowed to do this fully by setting its nickname=0 and therefore a standard node should not have this feature built in. Any node can however behave like a segment controller but use a nickname other then zero. \n\nTime is UTC.\n"

All nodes that have a nickname-ID that is not set to 0xFF should send this event before they go on line to do their “day to day” work.\n\nNormally all nodes should save their assigned nickname-ID in non-volatile memory and use this assigned ID when powered up. A segment controller can however keep track of nodes that it controls and reassign the ID to a node that it did not get a new node on-line event from. This is the method a segment controller uses to detect nodes that have been removed from the segment.\n\nFor the nickname discovery procedure this event is used as the probe. The difference between a probe and a new node on line is that the later has the same originating nickname as value in byte 0.\n\nIf a node send this event with the unassigned ID 0xFF and byte 0 set to 0xFF it has given up the search for a free ID.\n\nIt is recommended that also level II nodes send this event when they come alive. In this case the target address is the 16-byte data GUID of the node with MSB in the first byte. \n\n | Data | Description | \n | :----: | ----------- | \n | 0    | **Target address**.

The SI unit (or the SI derived unit) is also used as the default unit. As in the SI unit standard, names for a unit is in lower case (\"newton\") and the unit (\"N\") is in upper case.\n\n**Byte 0** is the data coding byte for all measurement packages. The default unit has bits 0,1,2 set to 000 and the first optional unit 001 and so on. It also have a field for the item ( if more than one sensor is controlled by the node) that the value belongs to. See [data-coding](./vscp_data_coding.md) for a full description on data coding used.\n\nAll events in this class are mirrored in [CLASS1.MEASUREMENT32=70 (0x46)](./class1.measurement32.md_) as a single precision float. Default unit is used.\n\nAll events in this class are mirrored in [CLASS1.MEASUREMENT64=60 (0x3C)](./class1.measurement64.md) as floating point values using only the default unit .\n\nAll events in this class are mirrored in [CLASS1.MEASUREZONE=65 (0x41)](./class1.measurezone.md) as normalized integer values with index, zone, sub-zone.

In locations north of 48°24' N or south of 48°24', it never gets darker than this near the middle of the summer solstice (June or December).\n\nTechnically, the start and end times are when the true geocentric position of the Sun is 108 degrees from the zenith position, or directly above the observer.\n\nAstronomical twilight is the period when the center of the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon.\n\n | Data byte | Description                                                        | \n | :---------: | -----------                                                        | \n | 0         | User specified.                                                    | \n | 1         | Zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all zones.         | \n | 2         | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones. | \n"

To use this functionality\n\n\n*  Open a log channel with a specific id.\n\n*  Send logging events.\n\n*  Close when no more logging events will be sent on that channel.\n\nThe logging message can be a maximum of five byte for each event. If you need more space for logging data, send multiple log events and increase the index (starting at zero) for each event that is part of the logging message. Repeating this process next time you need to send logging data by again starting at index 0 and increasing for every part sent. \n\nThe id is something you set that have meaning for you. Typically it can be used as an index for a channel you send log messages on in a system where several subsystems needs to be logged and which log info need to be separated. \n\nRemember that the receiving side also have the originating id (GUID) as an identification from where a logging event originates.\n",

For [CLASS2.PROTOCOL1](./class1.protocol.md) the first 16 bytes of the data field is the GUID of the node the event is intended for. \n\nThis is used for translation in the VSCP daemon for instance where a level II client can send events that are automatically sent to the correct interface and is addressed to the correct device in question. To use this feature send events with the GUID of the i/f where the device is located when addressing is needed. The correct nickname is needed and it should be set in GUID byte 16.\n\nAn event with a class >= 512 but < 1024 will be sent to all Level II clients and to the correct i/f (the one that have the addressed GUID). A response form the device will go out as as a Level II event using the GUID of the interface but class will always have a value < 512 for a response event just as all events originating from a device. If you send 512-events with an external node as destination GUID (which is not the GUID of an interface) the event will be put through all interfaces.\n\nNote that the LSB of an interface GUID is always the nickname-ID for a device interface. \n\n###  Some Examples \n\n#### Type = 6 (0x06) Set nickname-ID for node.\n\nTo set a new nickname for a node send the following event\n\n    Class=512, Level I Protocol, Type=6 (0x06)  \n    Set nickname-ID for node. \n\n | Byte | Description | \n | :----: | ----------- | \n | 0-15 | GUID for Interface where node is located. | \n | 16   | Old nickname for node. | \n | 17   | The nickname for the node. | \n\nResponse is\n\n    Class=0, Level I Protocol, Type=7 (0x07) \n    Nickname-ID accepted. \n    \nNo data bytes\n\nNote the the LSB of the GUID contains the nickname is in both cases but that this is of no use when the event is sent but should be used to verify that the correct node answered when the response is received.\n\n#### Type = 9 (0x09) Read register.\n\nTo read a register of a node send the following event\n\n    Class=512, Level I Protocol, Type=9 (0x09) \n    Read register. \n\n | Byte | Description | \n | :----: | ----------- | \n | 0-15 | GUID for Interface where node is located.

A node that receive (and recognize) this event could respond with a CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 event (HEARTBEAT) and should do so if it does not send out a regular heartbeat event.\n\nOther nodes can originate this event on the segment. For these nodes the data part, as specified below, should be omitted. A better choice for periodic heartbeat events from a node may be [CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 (HEARTBEAT)](./class1.information.md#type9)\n\nAll nodes that recognize this event should save the 8-bit CRC in non-volatile storage and use it on power up. When a node starts up on a segment it should begin to listen for the Segment controller heartbeat. When/if it is received the node compares it with the stored value and if equal and the node is assigned a nickname-ID it continues to its working mode. If different, the node has detected that it has been moved to a new segment and therefore must drop its nickname-ID and enters the configuration mode to obtain a new nickname-ID from the segment controller.\n\nIf the node is in working mode and its nickname-ID changes, the node should do a complete restart after first setting all controls to their default state.\n\nAs a segment can be without a segment controller this event is not available on all segments and is not mandatory. \n\n | Data byte | Description | \n | :---------: | ----------- | \n | 0 | 8-bit CRC of the segment controller GUID. | \n | 1 | MSB of time since epoch (optional). |\n | 2  | Time since epoch (optional). | \n | 3         | Time since epoch (optional).|\n | 4         | LSB of time since epoch | \n\nUninitiated nodes have the CRC of the segment controller set to 0xFF.\n\nA node that is initialized on a segment and does not receive a Heartbeat can take the role of segment controller if it wishes to do so.

Apparent power, also known as demand, is the measure of the amount of power used to run machinery and equipment during a certain period. It is found by multiplying (kVA = V x A).

Apparent power, also known as demand, is the measure of the amount of power used to run machinery and equipment during a certain period. It is found by multiplying (kVA = V x A).
