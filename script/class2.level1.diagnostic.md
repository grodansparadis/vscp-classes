# Class=1018 (0x03FA) - Class2 Level I Diagnostic

    CLASS2.LEVEL1.DIAGNOSTIC

## Description

This class mirrors the [CLASS1.DIAGNOSTIC](./class1.diagnostic.md) class but use a different data format with a GUID stored in the first 16 bytes of the data followed by the standard data thus offset with 16-bytes.

See [CLASS2.PROTOCOL1](./class2.protocol1.md) for more information on the data format.
