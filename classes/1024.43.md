Read a Level II register from the 32-bit register space directly

This is a variant of the standard level II register read VSCP2_TYPE_PROTOCOL_READ_REGISTER but without the GUID that address the device. This is for situations where the client talking to the device has a direct channel to the device and the GUID is  not needed to select the device to read data from.


Be aware that a node may send several read/write response events to fullfil a read request.
