Indicates an alarm condition.

 | Data byte | Description                                                        |
 | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
 |     0     | Alarm byte from standard register 128/0x80.                             |
 |     1     | Zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all zones.         |
 |     2     | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones. |

If byte 0 is zero this event can be interpreted as alarm-reset.

If both or one of zone/sub-zone are omitted they should be interpreted as if they where 255.
