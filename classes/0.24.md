**Mandatory.** Should be implemented by all level I devices.

The page read is implemented to make it possible to read/write larger blocks of data. Two register positions are reserved to select a base into this storage. This is a 16-bit number pointing to a 256-byte page. This means that a total of 65535 * 256 bytes are accessible with this method (page 0 is the standard registers).

To read a block of data from the storage, first write the base registers then issue this event and n events will be sent out from the node containing the data from the specified area. If the count pass the border it of the page ( > 0xFF) the transfer will end there.

Note that the page select registers only selects a virtual page that can be accessed with page read/write and not with the ordinary read/write.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | Node-ID which registers should be read. | 
 | 1 | Index into page. | 
 | 2 | Number of bytes to read (1-255). | 

 for 16-bit id

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | Node-ID MSB which registers should be read. | 
 | 1 | Node-ID LSB which registers should be read. | 
 | 2 | Index into page. | 
 | 3 | Number of bytes to read (1-255). |
