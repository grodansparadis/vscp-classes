**Mandatory.** Should be implemented by all devices.

The page read is implemented to make it possible to read/write larger blocks of data. Two register positions are reserved to select a base into this storage. This is a 16-bit number pointing to a 256-byte page. This means that a total of 65535 * 256 bytes are accessible with this method (page 0 is the standard registers).

To read a block of data from the storage, first write the base registers then issue this event and n events will be sent out from the node containing the data from the specified area. If the count pass the border it of the page ( > 0xFF) the transfer will end there.

Note that the page select registers only selects a virtual page that can be accessed with page read/write and not with the ordinary read/write.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | Node-ID which registers should be read. | 
 | 1 | Index into page. | 
 | 2 | Number of bytes to read (1-255). | 

Response is 

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=26 (Read page response)](https://grodansparadis.gitbooks.io/the-vscp-specification/class1.protocol.html#type26)


The following format can be used for nodes on a Level II segment as a midway between a full Level II handling as specified in Class=1024 and Level I. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0-15 | GUID. |
 | 16 | Index into page. | 
 | 17 | Number of bytes to read (1-255). |
