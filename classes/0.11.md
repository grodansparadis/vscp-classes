Write register content to a node. 

*If a node have several pages with user defined registers Extended Register Write is a better choice to choose for writing as the page is also set when writing a register using that type. The standard registers can always be read without setting a page though as they are always mapped into the upper 128 bytes.*

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- |

A read/write response event is returned on success.
