Read a Level II register from the 32-bit register space

 | Byte       | Description                                      | 
 | ----       | -----------                                      | 
 | Byte 0-15  | Contains the GUID of the target node (MSB->LSB). | 
 | Byte 16-19 | Register to read (or start index), (MSB->LSB).   | 
 | Byte 20-21 | Number of registers to read (max 508).           | 

Number of registers to read can also be restricted by the buffer size on the board (register 0x98). If this register is set to something else than 0 (default) this is the max size for data.

This means that buffer_size - 8 is maximum data bytes read.
