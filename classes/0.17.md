**Not mandatory.** Only needed if a VSCP boot-loader algorithm is used.

Confirm the reception of a complete data block. This event has no meaning for any node that is not in boot mode and should be disregarded.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | MSB of 16-bit CRC for block. | 
 | 1 | LSB for 16-bit CRC for block. | 
 | 2 | MSB of block to write.         | 
 | 3 | block to write.                | 
 | 4 | block to write.                | 
 | 5 | LSB of block to write.         | 

The block to write is the block that was sent in the last block data event. The CRC is calculated over the block data only.
