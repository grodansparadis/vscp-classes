**Not mandatory** Only needed if a VSCP boot loader algorithm is used.

Part of the VSCP boot-loader functionality. This event is a negative response to a bootloader abort or rollback [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=55 (Bootloader abort)](./class1.protocol.md#type55).

Om a single slot firmware device where a firmware update has failed and there is no working firmware to switch back to this event should be sent to tell the controlling device that we can't leave the bootloader mode until a new full firmware has been loaded.

**This event was added in version 1.15.10 so we aware that older devices may not support this event.**
