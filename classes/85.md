## Description

This class mirrors the standard measurement events is [CLASS1.MEASUREMENT=10](./class1.measurement.md) but also have zone information and is intended for setting a value instead of providing a measurement.

This class can for example be used to set setpoints on a node. If 256 set points is enough (!!!) use index to identify the setpoint. If more is needed use subzone as a page into this storage and make this configurable on the node.

For large integers and strings several events may need to be used to set a single value.

 | Byte | Description                                                        |
 | ---- | -----------                                                        |
 | 0    | Index for device (This is NOT the same as senorindex is in data coding byte). |
 | 1    | Zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all zones.         |
 | 2    | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones. |
 | 3    | Data coding.                                                       |
 | 4-7  | Data with format defined by byte 0.                                |
