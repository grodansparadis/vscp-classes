Message for Log. Several frames have to be sent for a event that take up more then the five bytes which is the maximum for each frame. In this case the zero based index (byte 2) should be increased for each frame. 

 | Byte | Description            | 
 | :----: | -----------            | 
 | 0    | ID for event.          | 
 | 1    | Log level for message. | 
 | 2    | Idx for this message.  | 
 | 3-7 (511)  | Message.         |

 A **level II** node can use the full 512 byte message body.

 | Byte | Description     |
