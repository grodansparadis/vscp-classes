General Event.

You can use this event for anything you want. It's a general event, so it can be used for anything. The data format and the use is all up to your needs. It is important of course that you document the data format and the use of the event in your documentation and in the MDF for the device. But of course if there is an existing event that does the job you want, you should probably use that one instead of this one.
