**Not mandatory.** Only needed if a VSCP boot-loader algorithm is used.

This command is sent as the last command during the boot-loader sequence. It resets the device and starts it up using the newly loaded code. The 16-bit CRC for the entire program block is sent as an argument. This must be correct for the reset/activation to be performed. NACK boot loader mode will be sent if the CRC is not correct and the node will not leave boot loader mode. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :-------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | 16 bit CRC of full flash data block, MSB | 
 | 1 | 16 bit CRC of full flash data block LSB  | 

To leave boot mode just send this event and a dummy CRC. Other methods could have been used to load the code but it can still be activated with this event as long as the CRC is correct. This event has no meaning for any node that is not in boot mode and should be disregarded. 

Response can be 

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=48 (Activate new image ACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type48)

or

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=49 (Activate new image NACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type49).
