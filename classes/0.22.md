**Not mandatory.** Only needed if a VSCP boot-loader algorithm is used.

This command is sent as the last command during the boot-loader sequence. It resets the device and starts it up using the newly loaded code. The 16-bit sum of all CRC blocks that was transferred to the node (all memory types) is sent as an argument. This sum should be checked and be correct for the reset/activation to be performed. [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=49 (Activate new image NACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type49) will be sent if the CRC is not correct and the node will not leave boot loader mode. 

If just one memory type is programmed, the CRC sum is the same as the CRC for the programmed block. This can be used as an alternative way to program different memory types, that is enter boot loader mode, program an area, and then activate the new image, and then enter boot loader mode again and program another area, and so on.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :-------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | 16 bit sum of all CRC of blocks that was transferred to the node up to this point (all memory types), MSB | 
 | 1 | 16 bit sum of all CRC of blocks that was transferred to the node up to this point (all memory types), LSB | 

This event has no meaning for any node that is not in boot mode and should be disregarded. 

Response can be 

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=48 (Activate new image ACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type48)

or

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=49 (Activate new image NACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type49).
