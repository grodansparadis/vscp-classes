**Mandatory.** Should be implemented by all level I devices.

The write page is implemented to make it possible to write larger blocks of data. One data-space positions is reserved to select a base into this storage. See Page read for a full description.

It is only possible to write one 6-byte chunk at a time in contrast to reading several. This is because VSCP at Level I is aimed at low end devices with limited resources meaning little room for buffers. 

 | Data byte | Description  | 
 | :---------: | ----------- |
 | 0 | Node-ID         |
 | 1 | Register start. |
 | 2-7 | Data. |

Response is 

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=26 (Read Page Response)](./class1.protocol.md#type26)

The following format can be used for nodes on a Level II segment as a midway between a full Level II handling as specified in Class=1024 and Level I. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0-15      | GUID.       | 
 | 16        | Base index. | 
 | 17-â€¦    | Data.       | 

Data count can be as many as the buffer of the Level II node accepts.
