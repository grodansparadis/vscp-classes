 Write a Level II register to the 32-bit register space directly
 
 This is a variant of the standard level II register write VSCP2_TYPE_PROTOCOL_WRITE_REGISTER but without the GUID that address the device. This is for situations where the client talking to the device has a direct channel to the device and the GUID is  not needed to select the device to read data from.

 Care should be taken not to write to much data at the same time as there may be nodes
 that can't handle a full 512 byte frame. Better to seperate requests in bunches
 of 100 bytes or so.

 Also be aware that a node may send several read/write response events to fullfil a write request.
 
 | Byte       | Description                                      | 
 | ----       | -----------                                      | 
 | Byte 0-3 | Register to write (or start index), (MSB->LSB).  | 
 | Byte 4â€¦   | Data to write to register(s) (max 512-4 bytes).  |
