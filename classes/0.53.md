**Not mandatory** Only needed if a VSCP boot loader algorithm is used.

Part of the VSCP boot-loader functionality. This is the negative response after a node received
a [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=16 (Start Block data transfer)](./class1.protocol.md#type16) event (a part of a block). 
It is sent by the node as a validation that it can handle the block data transfer.
