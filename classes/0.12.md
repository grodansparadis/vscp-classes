**Mandatory.** Must be implemented by all devices.

Send NACK (Class=0,Type=14 if no boot-loader implemented)

This is the first event in the boot loader sequence. The node should stop all other activities when in boot loader mode. This also means that the node should not react on other events (commands) then the boot loader related.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | The nickname (LSB of 16-bit nickname) for the node. | 
 | 1 | Code that select boot loader algorithm to use. | 
 | 2 | GUID byte 0 (MSB) | 
 | 3 | GUID byte 3 (MSB + 3) | 
 | 4 | GUID byte 5 (MSB + 5) | 
 | 5 | GUID byte 7 (MSB + 7) | 
 | 6 | Content of register 0x92, Page select MSB. | 
 | 7 | Content of register 0x93, Page select LSB. | 

 For nodes with 16-bit id the same format is used as above. Byte 0, the nickname, is the
 LSB of the 16-bit nickname in this case. The content of the page select registers and the
 GUID bytes should be enough to make identify the device safely. But obiously it is very 
 important to set unique values in the page select registers before sending this event.

The following format can be used for nodes on a Level II segment as a midway between a full Level II handling as specified in Class=1024 and Level I. 

 | Data byte | Description |
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0-15 | GUID. | 
 | 16   | Boot-loader algorithm code. |
