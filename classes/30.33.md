Big Change level can be used in situations when the one byte level of CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=22 is not enough.

 | Data byte | Description  | 
 | :---------: | -----------   | 
 | 0         | Index        | 
 | 1         | Zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all zones.        | 
 | 2         | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones.   | 
 | 3-7       | Level as signed integer. The range can be adjusted by the user by sending just the needed number of bytes (1-5) which form the signed integer (MSB first). |
