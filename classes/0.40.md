**Not Mandatory.** Implemented if needed.

It is possible to ask a node which event(s) it is interested in with this event. If not implemented the node is supposed to be interested in all events.

All nodes are by default interested in **CLASS1.PROTOCOL**.

The event is intended for very low bandwidth nodes like low power wireless nodes where it saves a lot of bandwidth if only events that really concerns the node is sent to them. 

The response is [CLASS1_PROTOCOL, VSCP_TYPE_PROTOCOL_GET_EVENT_INTEREST_RESPONSE](./class1.protocol.md#type41) for a level I node and
[CLASS2_PROTOCOL, VSCP2_TYPE_PROTOCOL_GET_EVENT_INTEREST_RESPONSE](./class2.protocol.md#type41) for a level II node.
