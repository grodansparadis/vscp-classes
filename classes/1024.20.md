### Capability code

Description of bit-usage for VSCP server 64-bit **capability code**. A bit should be set only if the service is active.

 | Bit       | Usage                   |
 | :----:       | -----                |
 | 63 | Node supports VSCP remote variables. |
 | 62 | Node have a standard decision matrix. |
 | 61 | Node is a multi interface node (tcp/ip 'interface' command list interfaces). |
 | Bit 16-60 | Reserved.               |
 | Bit 15    | Have VSCP TCP server with VCSP link interface.  |
 | Bit 14    | Have VSCP UDP server.   |
 | Bit 13    | Have VSCP Multicast announce interface. |
 | Bit 12    | Have VSCP raw Ethernet. |
 | Bit 11    | Have Web server.        |
 | Bit 10    | Have VSCP Websocket interface . |
 | Bit 9     | Have VSCP REST interface. |
 | Bit 8     | Have VSCP Multicast channel support. |
 | Bit 7     | Reserved.                 |
 | Bit 6     | IP6 support.              |
 | Bit 5     | IP4 support.              |
 | Bit 4     | SSL support.              |
 | Bit 3     | Accepts two or more simultaneous connections on TCP/IP interface. A limited device may only accept one connection.   |
 | Bit 2     | Support AES256 encryption. |
 | Bit 1     | Support AES192 encryption. |
 | Bit 0     | Support AES128 encryption. |

**For programmers:** Bits are defined in vscp.h.

### Non standard ports

Non standard port definitions. Each consist of three bytes.
 | Byte | Description                                                                                                     |
 | :----: | -----------                                                                                                   |
 | 0    | 0-63 Identify the service from the bit number (see bit usage). Offset zero. Bit 7 is set if encryption is used. |
 | 1    | Port MSB byte                                                                                                   |
 | 2    | Port LSB byte                                                                                                   |

### Example

**Example:** The standard TCP/IP server is on port **9598** if it has been moved to port **32000** the three bytes will be

 | Byte | Description                                       |
 | :----: | -----------                                     |
 | 0    | 15 for bit 15 which is the TCP/IP server          |
 | 1    | 0xD4 which is the most significant byte of 32000  |
 | 3    | 0x00 which is the least significant byte of 32000 |
