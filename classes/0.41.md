A node that is interested in everything just send a [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=41 (Get event interest response)](./class1.protocol.md#type41) with no data if asked to provide that information.

Nodes that want to specify events of interest fill them in. If all types of a class should be recognized set the corresponding bit in byte 1 and the related type to zero.

A maximum of 255 frames (index = 0-254) may be sent. 

Fill unused pairs with zero.

A **level II node** respond by sending [CLASS2.PROTOCOL, Type=41 (Get event interest response)](./class2.protocol.md#type41)
