Turn on/off lamps on nodes in zone.

 | Data byte | Description                                                        | 
 | :---------: | -----------                                                        | 
 | 0         | If equal to zero off else on.                                      | 
 | 1         | Zone for which event applies to (0-254). 255 is all zones.         | 
 | 2         | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones. | 

See also [CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=40](./class1.control.md#type40) and [CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=42](./class1.control.md#type41) which don't use byte 0 but instead are separated in two distinct events.

It is recommended to use the more general [CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=17](./class1.control.md#type41),[CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=18](./class1.control.md#type18),[CLASS1.CONTROL, Type=19](./class1.control.md#type19) to keep a higher abstraction level. This event is keept for compatibility with legacy systems.
