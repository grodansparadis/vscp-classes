**Not mandatory** Only needed if a VSCP boot loader algorithm is used.

Part of the VSCP boot-loader functionality. This event is a way to check if a device is already in bootloader mode. A device that is in bootloader mode should respond with a [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=13 (ACK boot loader mode)](./class1.protocol.md#type13) event regardless of the internal state it is in.

**This event was added in version 1.15.0 so we aware that older devices may not support this event.**
