Index is increase by one for each event that builds up a specific event. If needed an empty (no data) can be sent as the last event else sending data to fill the display buffer will give the end automatically.

The text sent to a node can contain escape characters that themselves display data or other display events. Se the new_york node for examples of this.

For a multi line display one can use different sub-zones o address different lines. One can also us macro characters to map display events to a line.
