With this event it is possible to generate a timed pulse that is on for a specified time.

 | Data byte | Description                                                         |
 | :---------: | ----------- |
 | 0         | Optional byte that have a meaning given by the issuer of the event. Prefered use is _index_ for compability. |
 | 1         | Zone for which event applies to (0-254). 255 is all zones.      |
 | 2         | Sub-zone for which event applies to (0-255). 255 is all sub-zones.  |
 | 3         | Control byte.                                                       |
 | 4-7       | Set time as a long with MSB in the first byte.                      |

##### Control Byte

The control byte have the following bits defined

 | Bit | Description                                                          |
 | :---: | -----------                                                          |
 | 0-3 | Time code (see table below)                                          |
 | 4   | Reserved                                                             |

 | 6   | Send on event ( Class=20 Type = 3 (0x03) On ) when pulse goes on.    |
 | 7   | Send off event ( Class=20 Type = 4 (0x04) Off ) when pulse goes off. |

##### Time code

 | Code | Description                     |
 | :----: | -----------                     |
 | 0    | Time specified in microseconds. |
 | 1    | Time specified in milliseconds. |
 | 2    | Time specified in seconds.      |
 | 3    | Time specified in minutes.      |
 | 4    | Time specified in hours.        |
