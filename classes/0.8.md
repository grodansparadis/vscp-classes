**Mandatory.** Must be implemented by all devices.

Request a node to drop its nickname. The node should drop its nickname and then behave in the same manner as when it was first powered up on the segment. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0  | The current nickname for the node. |
 | 1  | **Optional:** Flags. | 
 | 2  | **Optional:** Time the node should wait before it starts a nickname discovery or starts the device. The time is in seconds. | 

**Optional byte 1 flags**

 | Bit | Description | 
 | :---: | ----------- | 
 | 0   | Reserved. | 
 | 1   | Reserved. | 
 | 2   | Reserved. | 
 | 3   | Reserved. | 
 | 4   | Reserved. | 
 | 5   | Reset device. Keep nickname. | 
 | 6   | Set persistent storage to default.| 
 | 7   | Go idle. Do not start up again. | 

So if byte 1 and 2 is not in event restart device, set default parameters and do a nickname discovery. If byte 1 and 2 are present and bit 5 is set load defaults into device, restart but keep nickname. In all cases byte 2 delays before the node is restarted.

 1.  With just one byte as an argument. The node should do a standard node discovery in the same way as if the status button of the node is pressed. Preserve initiated data,
 2.  If byte 1 is present bit 5: Just restart. Don't change any data. not even nickname. bit 6: Restart write default to persistent storage. bit 7: die die my darling. If both bit 5 and 6 is set, do 5 and then 6 == 6 or do 6 and then 5 == 6
 3.  Byte 1 + byte 2 Wait this amount of seconds after the above operation has been carried out.

There is a variant of this where the GUID is used instead of the nickname to identify the device, [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=23 (GUID drop nickname-ID / reset device.)](./class1.protocol.md#type23).
