**Not mandatory** Only needed if a VSCP boot loader algorithm is used.

Part of the VSCP boot-loader functionality. This event is a positive response to a bootloader abort or rollback [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=55 (Bootloader abort)](./class1.protocol.md#type55).

Event is sent before execution of the new firmware starts. It is used to tell the controlling device that the device is ready to leave the bootloader mode and start the new firmware.

**This event was added in version 1.15.10 so we aware that older devices may not support this event.**
