High Level Object (HLO) event is a command/response or other packed object sent to a device or sent as a response from a device. Content can be XML, JSON, character separated, BASE64, etc.

VSCP uses some of the contents in HLO events to pack driver configuration and other things. Therefore there is a restriction on tags used by user in that all tags prefixed with "vscp-" belongs to VSCP and should not be used by other applications. Apparat from that naming is completely free.On XML content this restriction only applies to the highest level tag. For example

```xml
<vscp-cmd />
```

is restricted. But

```xml
<vscp-cmd no-restrictions-on-attributes-here="">
<no-restriction-on-tags-here />
</vscp-cmd>
```

For JSON the restriction does not apply for sub object.

This event is not mandatory to implement by a device.
