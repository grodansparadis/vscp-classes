**Not mandatory.** Only needed if a VSCP boot-loader algorithm is used.

Begin transfer of data for a block of memory. This event should be followed by the block data events and then the programming of the block for each block until all blocks are transferred and programmed for a memory type. Other memory type can next be programmed starting with a new start block transfer event. Lastly the activate image event is sent by the master to activate the new image of the node.

As an alternative each memory type can be programmed in a separate session.

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0         | MSB of block number. | 
 | 1         | Block number. | 
 | 2         | Block number. | 
 | 3         | LSB of block number. | 
 | 4         | (optional) Type of Memory we want to write. See table below | 
 | 5         | (optional) Bank/Image to be written Used together with byte 4 to specify either separate Flash or EEPROM/MRAM spaces. If absent or set to zero normally, means first memory from the view of the node creator, e.g. internal Flash, internal EEPROM etc. Useful for projects that have internal as well as external EEPROMs so the external one could be addressed with byte5=1. Also with byte4=0 and byte5=1 an SD-Card as well as a second firmware image inside the flash could be addressed. |  

This event has no meaning for any node that is not in boot mode and should be disregarded.

**Type of memory to write (byte 4)**


 | Memory type | Description | 
 | :-----------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 or byte absent | PROGRAM Flash (status quo for old nodes) | 
 | 1 | DATA (EEPROM, MRAM, FRAM) | 
 | 2 | CONFIG (CPU configuration) | 
 | 3 | RAM | 
 | 4 | USERID/GUID etc | 
 | 5 | FUSES |
 | 6 | BOOTLOADER |
 | 7-252  | Currently undefined - send a NACK as response | 
 | 253 | User specified memory area 1 |
 | 254 | User specified memory area 2 |
 | 255 | User specified memory area 3 |

**Abstract memory ranges**

 | Range | Description |
 | :----: | ----------- |
 | 0x00000000 - 0x3FFFFFFF  | Flash memory |
 | 0x40000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF  | RAM memory |
 | 0xC1000000 - 0xC1FFFFFF | User id memory |
 | 0xC2000000 - 0xC2FFFFFF | Config memory |

 | 0xD0000000 - 0xDFFFFFFF | User 0 memory |
 | 0xE0000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF | User 1 memory |
 | 0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF | User 2 memory |

Response can be 

   [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=50 (Start block data transfer ACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type50) 
   
   or 
   
   [CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=51 (Start block data transfer NACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type51).
