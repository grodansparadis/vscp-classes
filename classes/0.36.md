**Not mandatory.** 

This is the response from a Get embedded MDF. The response consist of several frames where an index in byte0/1 is incremented for each frame and MDF data is in byte 2-7.

If an embedded MDF is not available a response on the form

     byte 0 = 0 
     byte 1 = 0 
     byte 2 = 0

should be sent. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | High byte of MDF description index. |
 | 1 | Low byte of MDF description index.  |
 | 2-7 | MDF data. | 

Note that if sending the events back to back some devices will not be able to cope with the data stream. It is therefor advisable to have a short delay between each mdf data frame sent out.

**Level II**: Level II nodes should respond with [CLASS2_PROTOCOL, TYPE=VSCP2_TYPE_PROTOCOL_GET_EMBEDDED_MDF_RESPONSE](./class2.protocol#type36)
