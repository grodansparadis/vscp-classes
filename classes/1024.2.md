 Write a Level II register to the 32.bit register space
 
 | Byte       | Description                                      | 
 | ----       | -----------                                      | 
 | Byte 0-15  | Contains the GUID of the target node (MSB->LSB). | 
 | Byte 16-19 | Register to write (or start index), (MSB->LSB).  | 
 | Byte 20…   | Data to write to register(s) (max 492 bytes).    | 

Number of registers to write can also be restricted by the buffer size on the board (register 0x98). If the buffer size is set to something else then 0 (default) this is the max size for data. This means that buffer_size - 24 is maximum data bytes written.
