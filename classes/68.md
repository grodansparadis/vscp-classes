## Description

Measurements with zone information. This class mirrors the standard measurement events is [CLASS1.MEASUREMENT=13](./class1.measurementx3.md) with the difference that index, zone, and sub-zone is added. This in turn limits the data-coding options to normalized integer (see [Data-coding](./vscp_measurements?id=datacoding) for a description). The default unit for the measurement should always be used.
