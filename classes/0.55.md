**Not mandatory** Only needed if a VSCP boot loader algorithm is used.

Part of the VSCP boot-loader functionality. This event provide a way to leave the bootloader in a secure fashion if there is problems loading firmware to a device. It is only available if the device has a bootloader that supports this functionality. Typically this is a device that has several firmware slots and can switch between them, and by that switch back to the last known working firmware.

The event can be sent in all states of the bootloading procedure.

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=56 (Bootloader abort ACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type56) should be sent as a positive response to a bootloader exit or rollback

[CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=57 (Bootloader abort NACK)](./class1.protocol.md#type57) should be sent as a negative response to a bootloader exit or rollback


**This event was added in version 1.15.10 so we aware that older devices may not support this event.**
