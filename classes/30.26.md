 | 0         | Sensor index for a sensor within a module (see [data coding](./vscp_measurements?id=datacoding). 255 is all sensors. | 
 | 1         | Zone for which event applies to (0-254). 255 is all zones.                                                                                   |

The sensor index can be used to index units within a module also or used as some other indexing schema.
