Index is increased by one for each event that builds up a specific event. If needed an empty (no data) can be sent as the last event else sending data to fill the display buffer will give the end automatically.

Many LCD displays allow definition of special characters. Use this event to define custom matrices buy defining a sub-zone for the user defined matrix(es).
